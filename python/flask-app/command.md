# Create an Image for Python application

## Build Image

To create an image, we need to exeucte docker build command and need to provide a context.

1. Open terminal and change the directory to parent folder of dockerfile

    ```
    cd <project-root>/python/flask-app
    ```
2. Execute docker build command and add current directory as context

    ```
    docker build -t python-app:latest .
    ```

3.  After image is created, we can run container using image.
    ```
    docker run --name python-app -p 8000:8000 python-app:latest
    ```


<B>Here 
- python-app:latest is the tag of the image.
- With '.' current directory is set as context for build command 
</B>
